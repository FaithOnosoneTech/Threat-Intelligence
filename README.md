# Threat-Intelligence
This repository holds information about my threat intelligence project on Globe Media News (Globe Media News is a Decoy name used for a real website in order to protect the information of the original company). This project displays usage of different tools to carryout threat intelligence.


### Globe media News (portal.globemedia.news) is a globally trusted media outlet facing rising risks of credential harvesting and misinformation sites masquerading as official subdomains. They’ve commissioned us the C25-03 team, an in‐house OSINT team for a passive reconnaissance engagement to map their external footprint, identify any “stale” or forgotten assets, and provide an executive summary of our findings.


### Scope and Rules of Engagement

- Target domain: portal.globemedia.news and subdomains
-	Passive only: no vulnerability scans, brute‐force, password trials
- Signed “OSINT Rules of Engagement & Checklist” [OSINT RULE](https://github.com/FaithOnosoneTech/Threat-Intelligence/commit/ce9854de683230994b2507323da7b6d89eac9cb2#diff-598f2dd3b91d530c849b235ea59cc1cc2418a4b82888b5fbeb753c51aa3fa2a6) and [Signed CHECKLIST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaithOnosoneTech/Threat-Intelligence/ce9854de683230994b2507323da7b6d89eac9cb2/1aii..png)

# Threat-Intelligence
This repository holds information about my threat intelligence project on Globe Media News (Globe Media News is a Decoy name used for a real website in order to protect the information of the original company). This project displays usage of different tools to carryout threat intelligence.


### Globe media News (portal.globemedia.news) is a globally trusted media outlet facing rising risks of credential harvesting and misinformation sites masquerading as official subdomains. They’ve commissioned us the C25-03 team, an in‐house OSINT team for a passive reconnaissance engagement to map their external footprint, identify any “stale” or forgotten assets, and provide an executive summary of our findings.
